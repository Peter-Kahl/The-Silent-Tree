### Abstract

The philosophical riddle ‘_If a tree falls in a forest and no one is there to hear it, does it make a sound?_’ dramatises a conflict that is not merely metaphysical but epistemic and political. This essay reframes the question through _Epistemic Clientelism Theory_, showing how assent to either physics or phenomenology constitutes a clientelist exchange with epistemic authority. Drawing on Locke, Berkeley, and Kant, alongside phenomenology, cognitive science, and political psychology, I argue that the puzzle exposes our dependence on authority structures. Silence is shown not as absence but as epistemic subjugation, resonant with Spivak’s notion of epistemic violence. Engaging Ivana Marková’s theory of epistemic trust and my own works on epistemocracy, free-range knowledge, and fiduciary openness, I propose that dependence need not degrade into clientelism. Fiduciary authority offers a way forward, binding epistemic power to duties of care, loyalty, and openness. The falling tree thus becomes a parable for our epistemic condition: vibrations exist, perception matters, but what counts as ‘sound’ depends on how authority is structured and how silence is dignified.

This paper forms part of a wider research programme on fiduciary-epistemic governance and will be integrated into my forthcoming monograph _Beyond Epistemic Clientelism_. Readers are welcome to cite it, but please note that revisions are likely as the material is incorporated into the book project.
